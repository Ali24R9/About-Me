							 	I was born in Torrance, CA in 1987. I lived in Torrance until 1990 when my family and I moved to Lakewood, CA. We have been there ever since. In 2005 I began attending Cal State Long Beach where I received my BA in Chemistry. After I got my degree, I found that it was very difficult to find a job and after some encouragement from friends I gave coding a try. Not too long after I found myself in the Coding Dojo bootcamp in Mountain View, CA. At Coding Dojo I learned many fundamental things about coding and I further confirmed what I had previously decided: I want to be a Web Developer.
